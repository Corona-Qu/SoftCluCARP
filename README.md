# SoftCluCARP
The soft-clustered capacitated arc routing problem (SoftCluCARP) extends the classical capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) with one additional constraint, i.e., the set of required edges (e.g., the streets to be serviced) is partitioned into clusters, and all required edges of the same cluster must be served by the same vehicle.
